#Project 2: Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset In this project, I combine MTA and Weather Underground data to analyze the relationship between NYC subway ridership and a number of variables including temperature, precipitation, day of the week and more.


##1. Statistical test

####1.1 Which statistical test did you use to analyze the NYC subway data? Did you use a one-tail or a two-tail P value? What is the null hypothesis? What is your p-critical value? 
I used the Mann-Whitney U-test with a two-tail P value. H0: the rain donsn't affect the ridership state . 
P-critical value: 0.05
####1.2 Why is this statistical test applicable to the dataset? 
because the sample is not normally distributed so i used Mann-Whitney U-test which does not make the assumption that the data follows a Gaussian distribution

####1.3 What results did you get from this statistical test? These should include the following numerical values: p-values, as well as the means for each of the two samples under test.
Mean(Rain): 1105.44637675
Mean(No Rain) 1090.27878015
U: 1924409167.0
one-sided p: 0.0193096344138
two-sided p 0.0386192688276 
####1.4 What is the significance and interpretation of these results? 
The P-value of the Mann-Whitney U test is <0.05 so we can conclude that the difference between the two means is not due to chance and applies to the entire population.
We can thus reject the null hypothesis that rain has no impact on MTA subway ridership. 
The means of the two samples suggest that ridership increases when it is raining.

##2. Linear regression

####2.1 What approach did you use to compute the coefficients theta and produce prediction for ENTRIESn_hourly in your regression model: 
Gradient descent

####2.2 What features (input variables) did you use in your model? Did you use any dummy variables as part of your features?

rain, meanpressurei
UNIT  dummy variable
####2.4 What are the parameters (also known as "coefficients" or "weights") of the non-dummy features in your linear regression model?

rain              -54.632103
meanpressurei    -328.596009
####2.5 What is your modelâ€™s R^2 (coefficients of determination) value?

R^2: 0.45756136309528872
####2.6 What does this R2 value mean for the goodness of fit for your regression model? Do you think this linear model to predict ridership is appropriate for this dataset, given this R2 value? 
R^2 value is 0.45  which mean 45% of the variation explanied by this model 
This distribution is ~ normal, histograms have limitations. A plot residuals vs. predictions, fit to a trend line, reveals that residuals increase as a function of predicted value. Clearly structure exists that is not accounted for by our model.

##4. Conclusion

####4.1 From your analysis and interpretation of the data, do more people ride the NYC subway when it is raining or when it is not raining? 
More people ride the subway when it is not raining.
